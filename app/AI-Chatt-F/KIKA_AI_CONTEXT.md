### 🚀 KIKA PLATFORM - AI CONTEXT HANDSHAKE

The screenshot uncovers the exact folder naming mismatch causing the 404 error.
Your folder inside the services directory is named voip-calls (with a trailing "s"), but our address path was looking for voip-call.
Because Next.js sets up web routes matching your folder names exactly, you just need to navigate to the pluralized address string in your browser:
👉 http://localhost:3000/services/voip-calls
🚨 Critical Check: 1 Unsaved File Error
I notice a solid grey circle badge next to the voip-calls folder, along with a number 1 next to your page.tsx file inside it. This means your dialer layout file is currently open but unsaved!
Next.js cannot compile or serve pages that haven't been saved to disk yet.
Click inside your app/services/voip-calls/page.tsx file.
Press Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac) to save your progress. The grey dot and number 1 badge will disappear.
🧪 Test the Portal
Once you have saved that layout file, refresh your web browser at:
👉 http://localhost:3000/services/voip-calls
The interface will render, and your diaspora ledger accounting mechanisms will launch. Try dialing a test phone number vector to check your browser media access pipelines!
Let me know if saving and navigating to the pluralized path opens up the terminal view without any issues. Once it works, are you ready to map out your secure gateway environment variables layout file (.env) to cleanly shield your live production API keys?
